    <h1>Window</h1>
    <p>The JavaScript window object sits at the top of the JavaScript Object hierarchy and represents the browser window.<br> The window object is supported by all browsers.<br> All global JavaScript objects , functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.<br> The window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser .<br> This window object has the majority of the properties like length, inner Width, inner Height, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.<br>

        The window object represents the current browsing context .<br> It holds things like window.location, window.history, window.screen, window.status, or the window.document .<br> Each browser tab has its own top-level window object.<br> Each of these windows gets its own separate global object.<br> window.window always refers to window, but window.parent and window.<br>top might refer to enclosing windows, giving access to other execution contexts.<br> Moreover, the window property of a window object points to the window object itself.
        
        So the following statements all return the same window object:
        
        window.window<br>
        window.window.window<br>
        window.window.window.window<br></p>
<h1>Document</h1>
<p>The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page’s content,<br> which is the DOM tree.<br> When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser , <br>it becomes a document object.<br> It is the root node of the HTML document.<br> The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc.<br> HTML documents, served with the “text/html” content type, also implement the HTMLDocument interface, whereas XML and SVG documents implement the XMLDocument interface.<br></p>
<h1>Screen</h1>
<p>Screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions . <br>It can be used to display screen width, height, colorDepth, pixelDepth etc.<br> It is not mandatory to write window prefix with screen object. <br>It can be written without window prefix.
